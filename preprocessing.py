    Returns
    -------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Preprocessed consumption data. Columns:
        ### Time-based:
        - Time: datetime, the hour of the measurement. **NB** Not intended to be used as a feature, but left in for
            convenience.
        - Hour: string, the hour of the measurement ("00" - "23", can be used as categorical)
        - Month: string, the month of the measurement ("01" - "12", can be used as categorical)
        - Season: string, the season of the measurement ("winter", "spring", "summer", "fall", can be used as categorical)
        - Weekend: bool, whether the measurement was on a weekend
        - Weekday: string, the weekday of the measurement ("Monday" - "Sunday", can be used as categorical)
        - Holiday: bool, whether the measurement was during a holiday
        - Days to holiday: int, number of days to the next holiday NOT IMPLEMENTED
        ### Location-based:
        - Location: string, one of the 6 cities
        ### Consumption-based:
        - Normalized consumption: float, the consumption normalized by the mean consumption of the location.
            **NB**: This is the target variable.
        - Mean consumption last 7 days: float, the mean (normalized) consumption the last 7 days
            **NB**: Since there is a 5 day data lag, this feature is the mean of the 7 days preceding the
            5 days preceding the measurement, i.e. |---7d used for mean---|---5d gap---|---measurement---|
        - Mean consumption last 14 days: float, the mean (normalized) consumption the last 14 days (same system as 7d)
        - Consumption 1 week ago: float, the consumption at the same hour 1 week ago.
        - Mean consumption at same hour last 4 days: float, the mean consumption at that hour last 4 days
        - Mean consumption at same hour last 7 days: float, the mean consumption at that hour last 7 days
        - Mean consumption at same hour last 14 days: float, the mean consumption at that hour last 14 days
        - Normalized consumption 1 week ago: float, the consumption (normalized) at the same hour 1 week ago.
        - Normalized mean consumption at same hour last 4 days: float
        - Normalized mean consumption at same hour last 7 days: float
        - Normalized mean consumption at same hour last 14 days: float
        ### Temperature-based:
        - temperature: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour
        - Temperature 1 hour ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 1 hour ago
        - Temperature 2 hours ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 2 hours ago
        - Temperature 3 hours ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 3 hours ago
        - Average temperature 4 to 6 hours ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hours 4-6 hours ago
        - Average temperature 7 to 12 hours ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hours 7-12 hours ago
        - Average temperature 13 to 24 hours ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hours 13-24 hours ago
        - Average temperature last week: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 1 week ago
        - Temperature one week ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 1 week ago
        - Average temperature two weeks ago: float, avg. forecasted temperature in the hour 2 weeks ago
